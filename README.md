The project was created for learning Vulkan.
What is done :
-normal maps
-defered rendering (using subpasses)
-implement PBR
-Paralax mapping
-instancing
-omniShadowMaps
-Particle compute shaders
-PB Bloom
-Multisampling
-usage SeccondaryCommandBuffer
Current goals:
-add SSAO
-use raytracing for shadows
-add animation (currently being implemented)
